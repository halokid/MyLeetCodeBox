            "content": "Here is a **User Story** tailored for an IT developer, based on your AI Workflow App using Google ADK:\n\n---\n\n### **User Story: AI-Driven Workflow Orchestration with Multi-Agent System**\n\n**Title:**\nAs a user, I want to describe my workflow needs in natural language and have an AI system organize, execute, and display the workflow using agents, so that I can automate multi-step processes without coding.\n\n---\n\n**Background:**\nThis PoC leverages **Google ADK** to build a **multi-agent architecture**, enabling dynamic workflow creation and execution based on user intent. The system involves a **Host Agent**, **Master Agent**, and multiple **Worker Agents** that communicate and collaborate to fulfill the user's goal.\n\n---\n\n### **Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n1. **NLP Interaction:**\n\n   * [ ] The system provides a chat interface where the user can express their workflow needs in natural language.\n   * [ ] The **Host Agent** interprets user input and extracts actionable tasks or goals.\n\n2. **Workflow Composition:**\n\n   * [ ] The **Master Agent** selects relevant **Worker Agents** from a predefined library.\n   * [ ] The **Master Agent** arranges Worker Agents into a sequence (or DAG) based on task dependencies and user goals.\n\n3. **Workflow Execution:**\n\n   * [ ] The **Host Agent** initiates workflow execution.\n   * [ ] Each **Worker Agent** receives tasks, performs them, and updates the shared **Session State** with results.\n   * [ ] Agents must operate independently but maintain a synchronized state via a session context.\n\n4. **Frontend Visualization:**\n\n   * [ ] A web interface displays the current workflow, showing:\n\n     * Agent names and roles\n     * Current task status (pending, running, completed)\n     * Results or outputs from each Worker Agent\n   * [ ] The UI updates in real time as the workflow progresses.\n\n---\n\n**Dependencies & Tech Stack:**\n\n* **Agent Framework**: Google ADK\n* **Frontend**: React or similar SPA framework (TBD)\n* **Backend**: Python/Node (depending on ADK integration needs)\n* **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket or polling mechanism\n* **Data Store**: In-memory for PoC, expandable to Redis/Postgres\n\n---\n\n**Notes for Developers:**\n\n* Keep agents modular and stateless where possible.\n* Design with extensibility: users may eventually define custom Worker Agents or new types of workflows.\n* Use mock Worker Agents for initial testing (e.g., math operations, data fetchers).\n* Prioritize traceability\u2014users should be able to trace how their input leads to specific agent actions.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like the **epic breakdown**, **technical tasks**, or **architecture diagram** next.\n"
